# Discorsa

Discorsa is a mod + web app that bridges the gap between Assetto Corsa and Discord.\
If you have a community centered around assetto, there aren't really any bots for enhancing that experience.

Discorsa is a mod, which saves your session data on a server, and is then accessible via the bot/website. 
You don't have worry about much, as long as you have an internet connection, the mod will handle everything. If you don't it will still handle everything lol.

All your laps are saved, and optionally posted to Discord channels that you selected. In the future the mod will also have support for drift sessions.

It will come with an API for guilds to post their own data to our servers and access it either from an endpoint or the bot itself.\
The API will be flexible, allowing servers to store their data in any format that they prefer. However if  you don't follow the conventions listed in the API documentation, then support for your guild data on our *bot* can not be garunteed.

## How do I get started?
You just run the setup command on the bot and follow the link. If you have your Steam account connected to your Discord, it will be quicker.

After you registered, you will be given a code. You must paste this code in the mod window for it to be authorized.
